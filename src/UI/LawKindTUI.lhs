\section{Introduction}

This module provides the text user interface for using automated proving based 
on law classifications.

The key idea is that we have collections of different kinds of laws
(\textit{e.g.}, simplifiers, fold/unfold, \dots),
and we want some form of automation that will try to 
use laws of a given kind to make progress.
When one law kind stops making progress, we will choose another kind.
We keep repeating this until no laws of any kind have any effect.

In a little more detail:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    Applying a law to a proof goal will involve searching the proof goal
    to find a sub-term of the goal where the law matches.
    If such a term is found, 
    we then return the proof goal with that sub-term replaced by the result of
    the match.
  \item
    Given a collection of laws of the same kind,
    we simply try to apply each such law to the proof goal.
    We terminate if a law suceeds in making a change,
    or if we have tried all laws in the collection.
  \item
    Given several such collections, we try each collection in turn.
    Whenever a collection fails to change the goal, 
    we switch to the next collection.
    When a complete run through of all laws in all collections 
    results in no change, we terminate.
\end{itemize}






\section{TUI Commands}

For now there is one prover-level command:

\begin{code}
doClassDrivenAutomation :: REPLCmd (REqState, LiveProof)
doClassDrivenAutomation _ (reqs,liveproof)
  = case applyCLA liveproof of
      Yes liveproof' -> return (reqs, liveproof')
      But msgs -> do putStrLn $ unlines' msgs
                     waitForReturn
                     return (reqs, liveproof) 
\end{code}
(This may change)

\begin{code}
acl = "automate classified laws"
applyACLDescr = ("acl"
                , acl
                , unlines'
                   [ "Invokes automatic application of classified laws"
                   , "to the focus and its sub-terms." ]
                , doClassDrivenAutomation)
\end{code}
\textbf{NOTE:}
Any new commands need to have their equivalent \h{applyACLDescr}
added to the long list in \h{ProverTUI.proofREPLConfig}.


\textbf{Important:} \emph{Any steps requiring user input need to occur here}

It might help to several commands here
\begin{itemize}
  \item Apply one law to the proof goal
  \item Apply a collection of laws to the proof goal
  \item Apply several law collections to the proof goal
\end{itemize}
