\section{Introduction}

This module provides the abstract functions for implementing automated proving 
based on law classifications (\textit{a.k.a.} kinds).

The overall task breaks down into two main components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
      The first implements taking a law 
      and searching through the current proof goal 
      to find a sub-term to which it applies (if any).
    \item 
      The second is about having various collections of laws, 
      grouped by kinds, 
      and how to automate their use in some systematic way 
      to make progress in proofs.
\end{itemize}

\section{Basic Abstract Steps}

\begin{verbatim}
moveFocusDown :: MonadFail m => Int -> LiveProof -> m LiveProof
moveFocusUp :: MonadFail m => LiveProof -> m LiveProof

matchFocusAgainst :: MonadFail m => String -> LiveProof -> m LiveProof

applyMatchToFocus1 :: MonadFail m => 
  Int -> LiveProof -> m (ProofMatch,[Variable],[Term],[ListVar],VarList)

applyMatchToFocus2 :: MonadFail m => 
  [VarTable] -> ProofMatch ->
  [(Variable,Term)] -> [(ListVar,VarList)] -> VarList -> 
  LiveProof -> m LiveProof
\end{verbatim}
Function \h{applyMatchToFocus1} is run first,
then the user may be asked to make some choices,
and finally \h{applyMatchToFocus1} is called with the resulting choices.
The overall effect has type 
\verb"MonadFail m => Int -> LiveProof -> m LiveProof".


\section{Abstract Commands}

\textbf{Important:} \emph{Nothing in this module should do IO of any kind}

This is \emph{very} tentative \dots
\begin{code}
applyCLA :: MonadFail mf => LiveProof -> mf LiveProof
applyCLA liveproofs = fail "Automating classifiers under development"
